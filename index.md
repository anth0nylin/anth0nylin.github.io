# Welcome to my corner of the internet!

## Who am I?

I am a senior at Adlai E Stevenson High School. I will be attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the fall of 2021 with a major in computer engineering.

## Recent Work

I am currently doing an internship during summer 2021 with Professor Stanley Chien of the ECE department at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). The project involves setting up a Z-Wave system and writing an application using the [openzwave API](http://www.openzwave.com/) to control the system. This application will be implemented in a building to regulate its energy consumption.

In the past, I have assisted with the JTRP incident detection project at IUPUI. A brief overview of the project can be found [here](https://et.iupui.edu/research/images/jtrp-incident-detect.pdf).
