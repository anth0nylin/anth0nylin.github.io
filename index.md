# Welcome to my corner of the internet!

## Who am I?

I am a senior at Adlai E Stevenson High School looking to pursue a degree in computer engineering.

## Recent Work

I am currently writing an application using the [openzwave API](http://www.openzwave.com/). This application will be implemented in a manufacturing plant to monitor energy consumption.

I have also assisted with the [JTRP Incident Detection project](https://et.iupui.edu/research/images/jtrp-incident-detect.pdf).
