# Welcome to my corner of the internet!

## Who am I?

I am a senior at Adlai E Stevenson High School looking to pursue a degree in computer engineering.

## Recent Work

I am currently writing an application using the [openzwave API](http://www.openzwave.com/). This application will be implemented in a building to monitor its energy consumption.

In the past, I have assisted with the JTRP incident detection project at IUPUI. A brief overview can be found [here](https://et.iupui.edu/research/images/jtrp-incident-detect.pdf).
